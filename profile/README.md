# Kubernetes Big Data Engineering Group

Community resource for big data and data science related software projects on techniques and best practices for integrating with Kubernetes. 

This group is different from [Kubernetes Big Data User Group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/ug-big-data) because, unlike Kubernetes User Groups where though their central goal is not a deliverable piece of work, one of the objectives of this project is to create user-ready deliverables and software tools.
